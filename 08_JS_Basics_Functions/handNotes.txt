- Functions let us wrap bits of code up into reusabel packages. They are one of the building blocks of JS,
    funciton doSomething() { //declaring:
      console.log("Hello World!");
    }
    doSomething(); //calling:
    If I just type the function name without parantheses and hit enter, console will give me function itself but not run it!
      doSomething
    With arguments,
      function area(height, width) {
        console.log(height * width);
      }
      area(9, 8) //72

- If I leave blank an argument whilce calling a function in JS, it will take it as undefined and not cause an error

- clear()
    Typing and hitting enter will clear the console
