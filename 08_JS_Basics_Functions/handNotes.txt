- Functions let us wrap bits of code up into reusabel packages. They are one of the building blocks of JS,
    //declaring:
    funciton doSomething() {
      console.log("Hello World!");
    }
    //calling:
    doSomething();
    If I just type the function name without parantheses and hit enter, console will give me function itself but not run it!
      doSomething

- clear()
    Typing and hitting enter will clear the console
