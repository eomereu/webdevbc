- To open JS developer console on Chrome,
    RightClick -> InspectElement -> "Console"Tab
  It is used to play around and test things out, basically.

- Five primitive datatypes of JS:
  1. Numbers (4,9.3,-3): It is a category for all types of numbers...
  2. Strings ("Hello!",'43'): Single/Double quotes, both OK.
  3. Booleans (true,false)
  4. "null" and "undefined"

- Classical operations with numbers:
    +,-,/,*,%

- Operations with Strings:
    1. Concatenation:
      "ali" + "veli" //"aliveli"
    2. Escape character is \
      \\,\"
    3. "Length" property:
      "ali".length //11
    4. Accessing individual elements: (indexing starts with 0)
      "ali"[1] //a
    Ex: "ali\\".length //equals 4 because one of the backslashes is the escape character! And so won't even be showwing up in the original string.

- Three types of naming the variables:
  1. camelCase: capital letter is in lowercase but the capital letter of every following word is in upper case
  2. snake_case: all in lowercase but there is an underscore between every word
  3. kebab-case (dash-case): all in lowercase but there is a dash between every word
    "camelCase" is used in JS

Defining Variables in JS
  - JS has dynamic typing which means we can change the variable types from one to another with just reassigning, it doesn't require any additional steps

  - To store variables in JS, we use "var", "let" or "const" keywords,
    1. var
      - var is scoped to "current execution context" AKA a variable's enclosing function or the global scope
      - can be reassigned whenever wanted
      - initializing value is optional
      - can be redeclared at any point (its datatype can be changed)
      - global variables are added to window
      Examples:
        var name = "Omer";
          name + "Erol" = "OmerErol"
          name = 99; //reassigning the variable with a different type
            2 + name = 101
        var myNum = 52;
          8 + myNum = 60
          myNum = 8; //reassigning the variable
            8 + myNum = 16
    2. let
      - let is "block scoped"
      - doesn't create property on global window object
      - initializing value is optional
      - can be reassigned
      - cannot be redeclared in the same scope! (its datatype cannot be changed)
    3. const
      - const is also "block scoped"
      - not immutable, but variable reference cannot change
      - cannot be reassigned!
      - must be initialized with value!
      - doesn't create property on global window object
      - cannot be redeclared in the same scope (its datatype cannot be changed)
      - its value cannot be changed but if it's a list or sth its content can be updated but its reference cannot be

- undefined: Variables that were declared but not initilalized which means when we create a variable and not initialize it, it's value becomes "undefined",
    var age;

- null: null is 'explicitly (on purpose and willingly) nothing',
    var currentPlayer= "Charlie";
    currentPlayer = null; //game over

Commenting in JS
  1. one-line commenting It is done with double slashes,
    //this is a one-line comment
  2. multiple-line commenting: It is done with slash and stars,
    /* this is a multiple
    line comment! */

- clear() function clears the console when used on the browser console.

Built-in Methods in JS
  1. alert: It pops up a message to the user, so it basically alerts the user,
    alert("Congratulations!");
    alert(52);
    alert(192+8); //200
  2. console.log: Prints something to the JS console so if someone doesn't have the console open, he naturally won't see this message,
    console.log("this is my console!")
    console.log(9/3) //3
  3. prompt: It lets us get input fron the user,
    prompt("Tell us your age please:")
    var userName = prompt("Tell us your name please:");
