- The pre-prepared Starter-Template,

- Colors,

		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/theming/#theme-colors
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/colors/#background-color
	Text Colors,
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/colors/
	Colors are brighter now in Bootstrap 4 than 3 and also it has bg-color, bg-light etc.

Typography between Bootstrap 3 and 4:
	https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/typography/
	At this point there is a class type for heading called as 'display heading',
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/typography/#display-headings
	Blockquotes,
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/content/typography/#blockquotes
		<blockquote class="blockquote">
			<p class="mb-0">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere erat a ante.</p>
		</blockquote>
		If we don't want the styling here we simply don't include the class="quote" part. Here class="mb-0" just sets the margin bottom of the paragraph to 0. And if we want the blockquote to be aligned right, we can add class "text-right" to the blockquote. But back in Bootstrap 3 there was a class called as "blockquote-reverse" for this mission,
			<blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
		Citation,
			<blockquote class="blockquote">
				<p class="mb-0">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer posuere erat a ante.</p>
				<footer class="blockquote-footer">Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite></footer>
			</blockquote>
		title attribute usually refers to the title of a work you are citing not the author

- It is now enough to change the default font size to make every text on the page to change dynamically. That's because they set the main unit size as rems not as pxs like back in Bootstrap 3.

Some features that didn't exist in Bootstrap 3 at all,
  Borders, (Bordered, Rounded, Left Blank, Color)
    border | rounded | rounded-top | border-left-0 | border-success
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/borders/
  Spacing, (m & p   t/b/l/r/x/y - 0/1/2/3/4/5/auto)
    p-x-3 -> make padding size-3 from both sides
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/spacing/
  Responsive Breakpoints, (responsive version of spacing for devices)
    p-md-5 -> start making padding 5 starting from size m up to xl
      PS: We don't specify the xs size explicitly, we use default to specify that size and we use the other sizes to move on like by specifying sm and furthermore...
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/utilities/spacing/#notation
    Breakpoints,
      https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/overview/#responsive-breakpoints
      xs - Portrait Mode Smartphones
      sm - Landcape Mode Smartphones
      md - Tablets
      lg - Laptop Computers
      xl - Desktop Computers

Navbars:
  https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/navbar/
  - We now have to specify the time of collapse of the menu (hamburger menu) in terms of breakpoints (sm-md...)
  - Also the ".bg-*" class is required in Bootstrap 4
  - "navbar-default" is changed to either "navbar-light" or "navbar-dark"
  - If I just change the navbar to "navbar dark", just the text will be changed to white, in order to do it in real means, I also need to change the background to "bg-dark" Here I have the built-in options that I used before both at "text" and "btn" which are "info-warning-success-primary-secondary-danger"
  - "navbar-expand-{breakpoint}" specifies the size that the navbar will be extended
