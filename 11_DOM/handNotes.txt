Note by the Lecturer,
Also, as you begin working with the DOM you'll be writing some JavaScript code that selects HTML elements from the page and manipulates them. 

When doing this, be sure to include your JavaScript code at the bottom of the HTML document, right before the closing </body>  tag.

The HTML will need to have loaded before the JavaScript is run, otherwise the JavaScript will throw an error because the HTML that it is trying to select and manipulate doesn't exist (yet).

See example below:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <title>Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Some HTML Code Here</h1>
  
      <script src="scriptfile.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>

- Here finally JS meets HTML+CSS

- The webiste 'https://www.patatap.com/' actually sums up this interaction. It changes the HTML and CSS as we push buttons in other word every time we interact with the page, JS adds or removes HTML/CSS to/from the page.

- DOM stands for 'Document Object Model'. It is the interface between our JavaScript and HTML+CSS. So it is basically JS objects, JS methods that we can use to interact with our HTML & CSS.

- The browser turns every HTML tag into a JavaScript object that we can manipulate. Each object models one of the elements on the page like body, head, title etc. And all these objects are created under the 'document'.

- When I type 'document' to the console, it doesn't give us the objects as we explained above. To get them as we mentioned, we can type,
    console.dir(document)
  So actually this will show things to us like the code we used while handling objects...

- We can summarize the process with two keywords: SELECT and MANIPULATE,
    The following code changes the 'h1' on the page to pink,
      // Select the 'h1' on the page and save it to a variable 
      var h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
      // Then change it to color pink
      h1.style.color = "pink";
    The following code blinks the body between blue and white every second,
      var body = document.querySelector("body"); //SELECT
      var isBlue = false;
      setInterval(function(){ //MANIPULATE
        if(isBlue){
          body.style.background = "white";
        } else {
          else body.style.background = "blue";
        }
        isBlue = !isBlue;
      }, 1000);
