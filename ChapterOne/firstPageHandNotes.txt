- Hitting Tab after typing html in Sublime, creates the boilerplate automatically for us. (After giving the file .html extension)

- MDN: Mozilla Developer Network (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

- <html> tab is the root of an HTML file, it is followed by <head> and <body> tags

- <head> tag, provides general information; so basically everything that we don't see on the paper as a user, things like stylesheet files, js files; they all go in the head. In conclusion, here is where we put metadata

- <body> is where we put all our content

- <!-- This is a comment -->, simply to fastly create a comment, select the content or go on a line and hit 'Ctrl + /'

- Although <title> won't show up on our page, it's important because it is the text that goes up to the tab name. And pay attention to the reason it won't show up on the page is it is in the head/metadata section. So it is also the name that shows up on the google results

- MDN Element Reference: Lists all the elements of HTML (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) around 100 or so but 15-20 of'em frequently used

- <h1> is the most, <h6> is the least important heading... Tags like this headings called as 'block level elements' which basically means even we write'em on a single line they are seperately shown on lines on the webpage

- 'Inline elements' are the ones which if written on the same line they are shown on the same line.

- <p> Paragraf tag makes the text block level

- <b> tag is the basic way to bolden a text; this is inline also; but there is a better tag to do it which is <strong> tag. Although it does exactly the same thing it emphasizes the importance of it in the source code -as far as I guess- and things like these tags called 'semantic mark' in HTML5

- <i> makes the text italic, it's inline; like the above one, <em> tag makes the same but a better way in terms of semantic marks

- <ol> tag creates an ordered list, which means every item takes number in front of it as 1,2,3 etc, and inside this list we have to specify every one of the elements with <li> tags

- <ul> tag creates an unordered list, which just takes bulletpoints in front of'em, again inside this list we have to specify every one of the elements with <li> tags

- we can make lists in lists

- Ctrl + Shift + D, automatically copies the current line and pastes on next line directly.

- First headings, outer lists, inner lists

- Inside an html file, typing "lorem" and hitting Tab right after it, is going to give a long text to us, automatically.

- <div> is a way of grouping things together. But actually it won't give us much benefit until we get to CSS. Because then we will go and style that group together. It is a block level element btw, which means inner divs will cause new lines

- <span> is also a generic container but there is a key difference is an inline one. So we will use this one inside of a div if we want to give that part a more specific feature along with the div features.

- Attributes: adding additional information to tags. Its form is like the following, a key-value pair,
	<tag name="value"></tag>

- <br> tag is a break line tag, which passes you to the next line

- We don't need a closing tag for <img>, <br> attributes.

- Anchor Tag is the one we all see in every Google search result actually, usage:
	<a href="url">Link Text</a>
I need to make my link explicit at this point. So I have to add that "http://" part at the beginning otherwise it tries to find that following part at my current folder!

- Table usage:
	<table>
	 <thead>
	  	<tr>
	  	 <th>Heading for 1st column</th>
	  	 <th>Heading for 2nd column</th>
	  	</tr>
	 </thead>
	 <tbody>
	  	<tr>
	  	 <td>1st row 1st column</td>
	  	 <td>1st row 2nd column</td>
	 	</tr>
	 </tbody>
	</table>
  tr used for creating rows, td for columns, th for headings
  <table border="1"> can be used to determine the borders but it makes more sense to do it with CSS
  <thead> and <tbody> tags are like the head and body tags of the page, it is optional but better to use
  <img width=""> can be used for reararranging the size of an image but actually we will be doing this by CSS later on. PS, it automatically scales the image by the given width

- In order to create multiple cursors in Sublime, simply hold Ctrl and click on places that we want the cursor to be on
