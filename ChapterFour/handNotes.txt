Bootstrap:
	Bootstrap is a really useful CSS and JavaScript library. It is a single CSS file and a single JavaScript file. Inside the CSS file there is a bunch of staff that we get for free.
	Components are the bigger pieces.
	We can either download it to our machine and work/load locally (just use link tag for this after moving the 'bootstrap.css' file to the work area) or we can include it online by using,
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">
	To include Bootstrap 4,
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-9aIt2nRpC12Uk9gS9baDl411NQApFmC26EwAOH8WgZl5MYYxFfc+NcPb1dKGj7Sk" crossorigin="anonymous">

- We can find any info and any choice of any element on the getbootstrap.com,
	Bootstrap 3,

		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/
	Bootstrap 4,
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/

- To simply overwrite the styles, we can create a 'style' section in the head of our HTML file,
	<style type="text/css">
		.btn-success {
			background-color: blue;
		}
	</style>

- Jumbotron
	Jumbotron is the big header like thing with an explanation and a button. It takes the 100% of the contain that it is inside of,

- Grid System
	To handle the kinda problematic thing above in other words to put some things to the center of the webpage or make it just 1/3 of the page etc. we normally use 'Grid System'. But for a basic solution we can also use the following 'container' class to handle it:

- Container
	A container is a predefined class in Bootstrap that used with 'div' tags. It automatically creates a container with predefined useful margines and width etc.

- Forms
	The advancedly modified version of the form we have seen back in ChapterOne:
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms
	
	.form-group | div
		A label-input pair is better used within "form-group" class to group'em together and add some spacing from the rest.
	
	.form-control | input
		Specifies the style of the input box and its effect when selected.
	
	.form-inline | form
		The class that used with the 'form' tag in order to make the form inline.

	.checkbox | div
		When we put label-input(checkbox) pair together inside this div class, the label there turns into a clickable text which is awesome
