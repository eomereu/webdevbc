Bootstrap:
	Bootstrap is a really useful CSS and JavaScript library. It is a single CSS file and a single JavaScript file. Inside the CSS file there is a bunch of staff that we get for free.
	Components are the bigger pieces.
	We can either download it to our machine and work/load locally (just use link tag for this after moving the 'bootstrap.css' file to the work area) or we can include it online by using,
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous">
	To include Bootstrap 4,
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-9aIt2nRpC12Uk9gS9baDl411NQApFmC26EwAOH8WgZl5MYYxFfc+NcPb1dKGj7Sk" crossorigin="anonymous">

- We can find any info and any choice of any element on the getbootstrap.com,
	Bootstrap 3,
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/
	Bootstrap 4,
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/
		https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/

- To simply overwrite the styles, we can create a 'style' section in the head of our HTML file,
	<style type="text/css">
		.btn-success {
			background-color: blue;
		}
	</style>
