- Box Model
	In a document, each element is represented as a rectangular box. In CSS, each of these rectangular boxes is described using the standart box model.
	Each box has four edges:
	1.margin edge: the space outside the box; kinda within the elements. Usages,
		margin: 20px; /* Same space from all sides */
		margin-top: 40px;
		margin: TOP RIGHT BOTTOM LEFT; /* More specified space from any side */
		margin: 0 auto 0 auto; /* Centers the element from left and right edges */
		margin: 0 auto; /* Specifies top to 0 px & right to auto, so indirectly fully centering from right and left again */

	2.border edge: the thickness of the border. Usages,
		border: 2px solid blue;
		border-width: 2px;
		border-style: solid;
		border-color: blue;

	3.padding edge: the space between border and the content inside of it. Usages,
		padding: 10px;
		padding-left: 20px;

	4.content edge: the text itself (width & hight). Usages,
		width: 20px;
		width: 60%;

	The space on the right of the content comes from the number 4, which is content edge -width- but the space on the left comes from number 3, which is padding edge -padding-left-. On the other hand, padding has also right spacing, which means we have two adjustments for the right side of our content.

	We can use a percentage on the width to make the website more dynamic and change itself depending on the body (window) size,
	p {
		width: 50%;
	}
