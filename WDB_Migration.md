Since the course is updated on 12/10/2020, "WDB_2.0_Migraiton_Guide.html" -prepared by lecturers- has been added to the repository.  

Also lessons starting from -including- #17 belongs to the updated version. Actually that's the breakpoint for front-end to finish, back-end to start.  

There are some important changes and additions to the previous lectures which I'll cover at the end of the course, both for not interrupting the usual flow and to remember related sections more closely.
