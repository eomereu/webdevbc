- It consists of key-value pairs. They are not part of an ordering.

- Objects can hold all sorts of data, nums, strings, arrays even other objects...

- An object syntax seems like the following,
  var person = {
    name: "Cindy",
    age: 32,
    city: "KÃ¶ln"
  };

- There are 3 ways of creating an object,
  2. Create'em all at once, just like above,
    var person = {
      name: "Travis",
      age: 22,
      city: "Linz"
    };
  1. Make an empty object then add to it,
    var person = {}
    person.name = "Travis";
    person.age = 22;
    person.city = "Linz";
  3. Make the empty object with a different notation,
    var person = new.Object();
    person.name = "Travis";
    person.age = 22;
    person.city = "Linz";

- Updating the properties,
  person["age"] += 1;
  person.city = "Berlin";

- To retrieve data from objects there are two ways:
  1. person["name"] //bracket notation
  2. person.name //dot notation

- We cannot use dot notation if the property starts with a number,
  someObject.1blah //INVALID
  someObject["1blah"] //VALID

- We cannot use dot notation if the property has spaces in its name,
  someObject.blah blah //INVALID
  someObject["blah blah"] //VALID

- We can lookup using a variable with bracket notation,
  var str = "name";
  someObject.str //doesn't look for "name"
  someObject[str] //does evaluate str and looks for "name"

  - In some languages 'objects' are called as 'dictionaries' thanks to the key-value pairs.

  - Actually arrays are a special type of objects that has the keys only as numbers.

  - To add a new key-value pair to an object,
    person.surname = "Odd";

  - An array of object is like the following,
    var posts = [
      {
        title: "Dogs are awesome",
        author: "Ryan",
        comments: ["Yeah I think so", "Nope!"]
      },
      {
        title: "Cats are awesome",
        author: "Bob",
        comments: ["Not really", "Of course..."]
      }
    ]
    posts[1].comments[0]; //"Not really"
    var myObject = {
      friends: [
        {name: "Ali"},
        {name: "Veli"},
        {name: "Ahmet"}
      ],
      color: "blue",
      isEvil: false
    }
    myObject.friends[0].name; //"Ali"
