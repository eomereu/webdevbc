CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- They are actually seperate files that we include into our HTML files.

- The General Rule:
	that every line we write will follow...
	selector {
		property: value;
		anotherProperty: value;
	} 

- 'Inline' styling is not a good idea because it doesn't seperate HTML and CSS files. Furthermore it's a lot of work to form lots of things all one at a time and especially when we want to make some changes to multiple elements,
	<h3 style="color: pink;">My Heading</h3>

- 'Style Tag' is also a bad idea, -on the other hand generally used for quick demonstrations and checks- coz it's also included in the HTML file but as a seperate part on top in 'head' part; which is mainly allows us to write some CSS code inside this tag,
	<style type="text/css">
		.
		.
		.
	</style>
	PS: /* Comment in CSS */

- So finally to write our CSS in a different file, we use <link> tag inside the HTML file. Hitting tab after typing 'link' will create a nicely prepared tag for us.,
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSSFileName.css">
	PS: It must be included in the 'head' section! 

- There are three types of color system:
	1.Hexadecimal
	2.RGB
	3.RGBA
	Actually the former two refer to the same thing but have differences in both syntax and base selection. The differencelatter two

- Hexadecimal colours contain six digits following a '#'. It's using base 16.
	#_ _ _ _ _ _ : First 2 represents how much red is the colour and the others green, blue respectively.
	 red grn blu
	#FFFFFF : White
	#000000 : Black

- RGB colours have slight different showing style. It's using base 10, the values show red, green, blue
	rgb(_, _, _)
			r  g  b
	rgb(255,255,255): White
	rgb(0,0,0): Black

- RGBA system adds a fouth field as transparency value whose range is between 0 and 1, (A stands for Alpha)
	rgba(_, _, _, ._)
			 r 	g  b   t
	rgba(100,82,12,1): No transparency
	rgba(100,82,12,0): Fully transparent (nothing shows up)
	rgba(100,82,12,.6): Little transparency (as getting closer to 1)
	rgba(100,82,12,.3): More transparency (as getting closer to 0)
