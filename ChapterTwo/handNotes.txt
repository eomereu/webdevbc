CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- They are actually seperate files that we include into our HTML files.

- The General Rule:
	that every line we write will follow...
	selector {
		property: value;
		anotherProperty: value;
	} 

- 'Inline' styling is not a good idea because it doesn't seperate HTML and CSS files. Furthermore it's a lot of work to form lots of things all one at a time and especially when we want to make some changes to multiple elements,
	<h3 style="color: pink;">My Heading</h3>

- 'Style Tag' is also a bad idea, -on the other hand generally used for quick demonstrations and checks- coz it's also included in the HTML file but as a seperate part on top in 'head' part; which is mainly allows us to write some CSS code inside this tag,
	<style type="text/css">
		.
		.
		.
	</style>
	PS: /* Comment in CSS */

- So finally to write our CSS in a different file, we use <link> tag inside the HTML file. Hitting tab after typing 'link' will create a nicely prepared tag for us.,
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="CSSFileName.css">
	PS: It must be included in the 'head' section!
